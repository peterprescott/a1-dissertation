                   based upon percentages obtained from grouping
                   individuals into a geographic area. The relation

                   Sociology, Andrew Abbott investigates central topics
                   in the emergence of modern scholarship, paying
                   special attention to "schools of science" and how
                   such schools reproduce themselves over time. What are
                   the preconditions from which schools arise? Do they
                   exist as rigid rules or as flexible structures? How
                   do they emerge from the day-to-day activities of
                   academic life such as editing journals and writing
                   papers? Abbott analyzes the shifts in social
                   scientific inquiry and discloses the intellectual
                   rivalry and faculty politics that characterized
                   different stages of the Chicago School. Along the
                   way, he traces the rich history of the discipline's
                   main journal, the American Journal of Sociology.
                   Embedded in this analysis of the school and its
                   practices is a broader theoretical argument, which
                   Abbott uses to redefine social objects as a sequence
                   of interconnected events rather than as fixed
                   entities. Abbott's theories grow directly out of the
                   Chicago School's insistence that social life be
                   located in time and place, a tradition that has been
                   at the heart of the school since its founding one
                   hundred years ago.},

                   on the socio-economic attributes of the residents of

                   to reduce 41 census variables to a single
                   socio-economic indicator. The classification was made

                   information as a National Statistic via National

  abstract =      {The 2011 Area Classification for Output Areas (2011
                   OAC) is a new open geodemographic classification of
                   the UK based on 2011 UK Census data. The 2011 OAC,
                   created in partnership with the Office for National
                   Statistics (ONS), supersedes the 2001 Area
                   Classification for Output Areas (2001 OAC) to provide
                   the most current open geodemographic view of the UK.
                   The 2001 OAC was widely used in academia, local
                   government and by commercial organisations, but its
                   reliance on data from the 2001 UK Census has led to a
                   perceived degradation of reliability over time and a
                   decline in users. The release of the 2011 UK Census
                   data provided the opportunity to create a 2011 OAC
                   which could address some of the acknowledged flaws of
                   the 2001 OAC, such as the methods used for data
                   handling, to create a more robust methodology. The
                   publication of this methodology with accompanying
                   documentation, in addition to utilising open-source
                   software, guarantees the reproducibility of the 2011
                   OAC; with an additional benefit of the methodology
                   being able to act as a template for future bespoke
                   open geodemographic classifications. Open
                   geodemographic classifications, unlike those provided
                   by commercial organisations, have historically been
                   unable to utilise ancillary data sources to enrich
                   and update their systems. This research proposes an
                   alternative approach; utilising the limited range of
                   Open Data sources made available regularly at the
                   small granular level to create uncertainty
                   indicators. These indicators allow areas of
                   uncertainty that develop over time within the
                   classification's geodemographic assignment to be
                   identified; allowing users the opportunity to take
                   compensatory action. This project delivered a new
                   open geodemographic classification of the UK. The
                   methodological advances, use of open source software
                   and ability to assess the temporal stability of
                   geodemographic assignments mean the 2011 OAC can be
                   considered a step forward for open geodemographics.},

                   the dominance of urbanism in the modern world we
                   still lack a sociological definition of the city
                   which would take adequate account of the fact that
                   while the city is the characteristic locus of
                   urbanism, the urban mode of life is not confined to
                   cities. For sociological purpose a city is a
                   relatively large, dense, and permanent settlement of
                   heterogenous individuals. Large numbers account for
                   inidividual variability, the relative absence of
                   intimate personal acquaintanceship, the
                   segmentalization of human relations which are largely
                   anonymous, superficial, and transitory, and
                   associated characteristic. Density involves
                   diversification and specialization, the coincidence
                   of social relations, glaring contrasts, a complex
                   pattern of segregation, the predominance of formal
                   social control, and accentuated friction, among other
                   phenomena. Heterogeneity tends to break down rigid
                   social structures and to produce increased mobility,
                   instability, and insecurity, and the affilitation of
                   the individuals with a variety of intersecting and
                   tangential social groups with a high rate of
                   membership turnover. The pecuniary nexus tends to
                   displace personal relations, institutions tend to
                   cater to mass rather than to individual requirements.
                   The individual thus becomes effective only as he acts
                   through organized groups. The complicated phenomena
                   of urbanism may acquire unity and coherence if the
                   sociological analysis proceeds in the light of such a
                   body of theory. The empirical evidence concerning the
                   ecology, the social organization, and the social
                   psychology of the urban mode of life confirms the
                   fruitfulness of this approach.},

                   where we live colours how we view ourselves and
                   others. That is why so many now place us into social
                   groups on the basis of the type of postcode in which
                   we live. Social scientists call this practice
                   commercial sociology . Richard Webber originated
                   Acorn and Mosaic, the two most successful
                   geodemographic classifications. Roger Burrows is a
                   critical interdisciplinary social scientist. Together
                   they chart the origins of this practice and explain
                   the challenges it poses to long-established social
                   scientific beliefs such as: the role of the
                   questionnaire in an era of big data the primacy of
                   theory the relationship between qualitative and
                   quantitative modes of understanding the relevance of
                   visual clues to lay understanding. To help readers
                   evaluate the validity of this form of classification,
                   the book assesses how well geodemographic categories
                   track the emergence of new types of residential
                   neighbourhood and subject a number of key
                   contemporary issues to geodemographic modes of
