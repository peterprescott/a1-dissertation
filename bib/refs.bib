  abstract = {In this detailed history of the Chicago School of Sociology, Andrew Abbott investigates central topics in the emergence of modern scholarship, paying special attention to "schools of science" and how such schools reproduce themselves over time. What are the preconditions from which schools arise? Do they exist as rigid rules or as flexible structures? How do they emerge from the day-to-day activities of academic life such as editing journals and writing papers? Abbott analyzes the shifts in social scientific inquiry and discloses the intellectual rivalry and faculty politics that characterized different stages of the Chicago School. Along the way, he traces the rich history of the discipline's main journal, the American Journal of Sociology. Embedded in this analysis of the school and its practices is a broader theoretical argument, which Abbott uses to redefine social objects as a sequence of interconnected events rather than as fixed entities. Abbott's theories grow directly out of the Chicago School's insistence that social life be located in time and place, a tradition that has been at the heart of the school since its founding one hundred years ago.},

  abstract = {Companies like Facebook accumulate data on a scale that is historically unprecedented, and they have immense power. Are these two elements linked?  Many people think that a logic of ``More data, more power'' offers a diagnosis of illegitimate digital power and a remedy for it, such as regulations that limit the collection of data. In this paper, we show why the logic of ``More data, more power'' misses the mark and, therefore, why many proposals for reforming companies like Facebook will not succeed. Having cleared the ground, we then investigate what would be a better way of thinking about digital power and its legitimacy. The old models of sovereign power and structural power, we argue, fail to accommodate a crucial and distinctive aspect of digital power, what we call empowering power. Companies like Facebook empower users of digital technology to interact on the basis of simple but versatile assignments of permissions, thereby facilitating the creation and distribution of new powers through a process of collective recognition and acceptance. Drawing on Searle's theory of institutions and Hart's theory of a legal system, we show that companies like Facebook confront us with a unique form of power. We ask how entities that provide us with such versatile means of empowerment and disempowerment can come to be legitimate. We develop and defend a framework for digital legitimacy, Custodial Caution, that assigns responsibility for the patterns of empowerment and disempowerment that are sustained by companies like Facebook.},

In this article, we situate one branch of Big Data analytics, spatial Big Data, through a historical predecessor, geodemographic analysis, to help develop a critical approach to current data analytics. Spatial Big Data promises an epistemic break in marketing, a leap from targeting geodemographic areas to targeting individuals. Yet it inherits characteristics and problems from geodemographics, including a justification through the market, and a process of commodification through the black-boxing of technology. As researchers develop sustained critiques of data analytics and its effects on everyday life, we must so with a grounding in the cultural and historical contexts from which data technologies emerged. This article and others (Barnes and Wilson, 2014) develop a historically situated, critical approach to spatial Big Data. This history illustrates connections to the critical issues of surveillance, redlining, and the production of consumer subjects and geographies. The shared histories and structural logics of spatial Big Data and geodemographics create the space for a continued critique of data analyses? role in society.},

  abstract = {The 2011 Area Classification for Output Areas (2011 OAC) is a new open geodemographic classification of the UK based on 2011 UK Census data. The 2011 OAC, created in partnership with the Office for National Statistics (ONS), supersedes the 2001 Area Classification for Output Areas (2001 OAC) to provide the most current open geodemographic view of the UK. The 2001 OAC was widely used in academia, local government and by commercial organisations, but its reliance on data from the 2001 UK Census has led to a perceived degradation of reliability over time and a decline in users. The release of the 2011 UK Census data provided the opportunity to create a 2011 OAC which could address some of the acknowledged flaws of the 2001 OAC, such as the methods used for data handling, to create a more robust methodology. The publication of this methodology with accompanying documentation, in addition to utilising open-source software, guarantees the reproducibility of the 2011 OAC; with an additional benefit of the methodology being able to act as a template for future bespoke open geodemographic classifications. Open geodemographic classifications, unlike those provided by commercial organisations, have historically been unable to utilise ancillary data sources to enrich and update their systems. This research proposes an alternative approach; utilising the limited range of Open Data sources made available regularly at the small granular level to create uncertainty indicators. These indicators allow areas of uncertainty that develop over time within the classification's geodemographic assignment to be identified; allowing users the opportunity to take compensatory action. This project delivered a new open geodemographic classification of the UK. The methodological advances, use of open source software and ability to assess the temporal stability of geodemographic assignments mean the 2011 OAC can be considered a step forward for open geodemographics.},

Strategies for resisting geosurveillance build upon other forms of resistance and include examination of the assumptions of geosurveillance, investigating privacy-focused software alternatives, and strengthening the ability of activists to operate in this sphere.

  abstract = {Urban theorists have tried for decades to define exactly what a neighborhood is. But behind that daunting existential question lies a much murkier problem: never mind how you define them--how do you make neighborhoods productive and fair for their residents? In Making Our Neighborhoods, Making Our Selves, George Galster delves deep into the question of whether American neighborhoods are as efficient and equitable as they could be--socially, financially, and emotionally--and, if not, what we can do to change that. Galster aims to redefine the relationship between places and people, promoting specific policies that reduce inequalities in housing markets and beyond. Drawing on economics, sociology, geography, and psychology, Making Our Neighborhoods, Making Our Selves delivers a clear-sighted explanation of what neighborhoods are, how they come to be--and what they should be.},

The results demonstrated that the spatial distribution of IUP at the country level showed significant positive autocorrelations indicating clustered spatial patterns rather than dispersed or random distributions. In addition, the temporal variation of the distribution disparity of IUP showed a decreasing trend at the country level during the study period. Further, sigma convergence of IUP during this period was detected according to the coefficient of variation. Last, the similarity of the IUP variation at the country level presented the spatial clustering feature with spatially contiguous countries in the world. In sum, the finding in this study indicated that Internet penetration may show the promotion of the balanced development trend over time in the world and the spatial characteristics of Internet development should be considered in the future policy globally.},

Only when spatial technologies such as GIS are understood as part of a nexus of relations which includes academia in the commodification of information can GIS practice by fully analyzed. A four-stage sequence of ethical practice is proposed, in which GIS has achieved the second stage. GIS practice and use is a fluctuating, contested area, which, therefore, is not suited to a rigid code of ethics. A better approach is based in the internalist and externalist dialectic.}

This article develops a name-led framework to overcome these limitations in using social media data to study urban places. The framework first derives place names from georeferenced Twitter data combining text mining and spatial point pattern analysis, then estimates the spatial extents by spatial clustering, and further extracts their dynamic functions with time, which makes up a complete place profile. The framework is tested on a case study in Camden Borough, London and the results are evaluated through comparisons to the Foursquare point of interest data. This name-led approach enables the shift from space-based analysis to place-based analysis of urban space.},

You get a gestalt view of the agile development process, including comprehensive guidance for non-technical readers and hands-on technical practices for developers and testers.The Art of Agile Development gives you clear answers to questions such as:How can we adopt agile development?Do we really need to pair program?What metrics should we report?What if I can't get my customer to participate?How much documentation should we write?When do we design and architect?As a non-developer, how should I work with my agile team?Where is my product roadmap?How does QA fit in?The book teaches you how to adopt XP practices, describes each practice in detail, then discusses principles that will allow you to modify XP and create your own agile method. In particular, this book tackles the difficult aspects of agile development: the need for cooperation and trust among team members.Whether you're currently part of an agile team, working with an agile team, or interested in agile development, this book provides the practical tips you need to start practicing agile development. As your experience grows, the book will grow with you, providing exercises and information that will teach you first to understand the rules of agile development, break them, and ultimately abandon rules altogether as you master the art of agile development."Jim Shore and Shane Warden expertly explain the practices and benefits of Extreme Programming. They offer advice from their real-world experiences in leading teams. They answer questions about the practices and show contraindications - ways that a practice may be mis-applied.

After the hubristic declaration of the ?end of theory? more nuanced arguments have emerged, suggesting that increasingly pervasive data collection and quantification may have significant implications for the social sciences, even if the social, scientific, political, and economic agendas behind big data are less new than they are often portrayed. Compared to the boosterish tone of much of its press, academic critiques of big data have been relatively muted, often focusing on the continued importance of more traditional forms of domain knowledge and expertise. Indeed, many academic responses to big data enthusiastically celebrate the availability of new data sources and the potential for new insights and perspectives they may enable. Undermining many of these critiques is a lack of attention to the role of technology in society, particularly with respect to the labor process, the continued extension of labor relations into previously private times and places, and the commoditization of more and more aspects of everyday life. In this article, we parse a variety of big data definitions to argue that it is only when individual datums by the million, billion, or more are linked together algorithmically that ?big data? emerges as a commodity. Such decisions do not occur in a vacuum but as part of an asymmetric power relationship in which individuals are dispossessed of the data they generate in their day-to-day lives. We argue that the asymmetry of this data capture process is a means of capitalist ?accumulation by dispossession? that colonizes and commodifies everyday life in ways previously impossible. Situating the promises of ?big data? within the utopian imaginaries of digital frontierism, we suggest processes of data colonialism are actually unfolding behind these utopic promises. Amid private corporate and academic excitement over new forms of data analysis and visualization, situating big data as a form of capitalist expropriation and dispossession stresses the urgent need for critical, theoretical understandings of data and society.},

  abstract = {The urbanization of the world, which is one of the most impressive facts of modern times, has wrought profound changes in virtually every phase of social life. The recency and rapidity of urbanization in the United States accounts for the acuteness of our urban problems and our lack of awareness of them. Despite the dominance of urbanism in the modern world we still lack a sociological definition of the city which would take adequate account of the fact that while the city is the characteristic locus of urbanism, the urban mode of life is not confined to cities. For sociological purpose a city is a relatively large, dense, and permanent settlement of heterogenous individuals. Large numbers account for inidividual variability, the relative absence of intimate personal acquaintanceship, the segmentalization of human relations which are largely anonymous, superficial, and transitory, and associated characteristic. Density involves diversification and specialization, the coincidence of social relations, glaring contrasts, a complex pattern of segregation, the predominance of formal social control, and accentuated friction, among other phenomena. Heterogeneity tends to break down rigid social structures and to produce increased mobility, instability, and insecurity, and the affilitation of the individuals with a variety of intersecting and tangential social groups with a high rate of membership turnover. The pecuniary nexus tends to displace personal relations, institutions tend to cater to mass rather than to individual requirements. The individual thus becomes effective only as he acts through organized groups. The complicated phenomena of urbanism may acquire unity and coherence if the sociological analysis proceeds in the light of such a body of theory. The empirical evidence concerning the ecology, the social organization, and the social psychology of the urban mode of life confirms the fruitfulness of this approach.}

  abstract = {The street network is an important aspect of cities and contains crucial information about their organization and evolution. Characterizing and comparing various street networks could then be helpful for a better understanding of the mechanisms governing the formation and evolution of these systems. Their characterization is however not easy: there are no simple tools to classify planar networks and most of the measures developed for complex networks are not useful when space is relevant. Here, we describe recent efforts in this direction and new methods adapted to spatial networks. We will first discuss measures based on the structure of shortest paths, among which the betweenness centrality. In particular for time-evolving road networks, we will show that the spatial distribution of the betweenness centrality is able to reveal the impact of important structural transformations. Shortest paths are however not the only relevant ones. In particular, they can be very different from those with the smallest number of turns?the simplest paths. The statistical comparison of the lengths of the shortest and simplest paths provides a nontrivial and nonlocal information about the spatial organization of planar graphs. We define the simplicity index as the average ratio of these lengths and the simplicity profile characterizes the simplicity at different scales. Measuring these quantities on artificial (roads, highways, railways) and natural networks (leaves, insect wings) show that there are fundamental differences?probably related to their different function?in the organization of urban and biological systems: there is a clear hierarchy of the lengths of straight lines in biological cases, but they are randomly distributed in urban systems. The paths are however not enough to fully characterize the spatial pattern of planar networks such as streets and roads. Another promising direction is to analyze the statistics of blocks of the planar network. More precisely, we can use the conditional probability distribution of the shape factor of blocks with a given area, and define what could constitute the fingerprint of a city. These fingerprints can then serve as a basis for a classification of cities based on their street patterns. This method applied on more than 130 cities in the world leads to four broad families of cities characterized by different abundances of blocks of a certain area and shape. This classification will be helpful for identifying dominant mechanisms governing the formation and evolution of street patterns.},

  abstract = {Unprecedented urbanisation processes characterise the Great Acceleration, urging urban researchers to make sense of data analysis in support of evidence-based and large-scale decision-making. Urban morphologists are no exception since the impact of urban form on fundamental natural and social patterns (equity, prosperity and resource consumption's efficiency) is now fully acknowledged. However, urban morphology is still far from offering a comprehensive and reliable framework for quantitative analysis. Despite remarkable progress since its emergence in the late 1950s, the discipline still exhibits significant terminological inconsistencies with regards to the definition of the fundamental components of urban form, which prevents the establishment of objective models for measuring it. In this article, we present a study of existing methods for measuring urban form, with a focus on terminological inconsistencies, and propose a systematic and comprehensive framework to classify urban form characters, where `urban form character' stands for a characteristic (or feature) of one kind of urban form that distinguishes it from another kind. In particular, we introduce the Index of Elements that allows for a univocal and non-interpretive description of urban form characters. Based on such Index of Elements, we develop a systematic classification of urban form according to six categories (dimension, shape, spatial distribution, intensity, connectivity and diversity) and three conceptual scales (small, medium, large) based on two definitions of scale (extent and grain). This framework is then applied to identify and organise the urban form characters adopted in available literature to date. The resulting classification of urban form characters reveals clear gaps in existing research, in particular, in relation to the spatial distribution and diversity characters. The proposed framework reduces the current inconsistencies of urban morphology research, paving the way to enhanced methods of urban form systematic and quantitative analysis at a global scale.},

  abstract = {Any study that examines the effects of area-based attributes on individual behaviors or outcomes faces another fundamental methodological problem besides the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). It is the problem that results about these effects can be affected by how contextual units or neighborhoods are geographically delineated and the extent to which these areal units deviate from the true geographic context. The problem arises because of the spatial uncertainty in the actual areas that exert the contextual influences under study and the temporal uncertainty in the timing and duration in which individuals experienced these contextual influences. Using neighborhood effects and environmental health research as a point of departure, this article clarifies the nature and sources of this problem, which is referred to as the uncertain geographic context problem (UGCoP). It highlights some of the inferential errors that the UGCoP might cause and discusses some means for mitigating the problem. It reviews recent studies to show that both contextual variables and research findings are sensitive to different delineations of contextual units. The article argues that the UGCoP is a problem as fundamental as the MAUP but is a different kind of problem. Future research needs to pay explicit attention to its potential confounding effects on research results and to methods for mitigating the problem.},

  abstract = {Where do neighborhoods come from and why do certain resources and effects--such as social capital and collective efficacy--bundle together in some neighborhoods and not in others? From the Ground Up argues that neighborhood communities emerge from neighbor networks, and shows that these social relations are unique because of particular geographic qualities. Highlighting the linked importance of geography and children to the emergence of neighborhood communities, Rick Grannis models how neighboring progresses through four stages: when geography allows individuals to be conveniently available to one another; when they have passive contacts or unintentional encounters; when they actually initiate contact; and when they engage in activities indicating trust or shared norms and values. Seamlessly integrating discussions of geography, household characteristics, and lifestyle, Grannis demonstrates that neighborhood communities exhibit dynamic processes throughout the different stages. He examines the households that relocate in order to choose their neighbors, the choices of interactions that develop, and the exchange of beliefs and influence that impact neighborhood communities over time. Grannis also introduces and explores two geographic concepts--t-communities and street islands--to capture the subtle features constraining residents' perceptions of their environment and community. Basing findings on thousands of interviews conducted through door-to-door canvassing in the Los Angeles area as well as other neighborhood communities, From the Ground Up reveals the different ways neighborhoods function and why these differences matter.},

We use the conditional probability distribution of shape factor of blocks with a given area and define what could constitute the `fingerprint' of a city. Using a simple hierarchical clustering method, these fingerprints can then serve as a basis for a typology of cities. We apply this method to a set of 131 cities in the world, and at an intermediate level of the dendrogram, we observe four large families of cities characterized by different abundances of blocks of a certain area and shape. At a lower level of the classification, we find that most European cities and American cities in our sample fall in their own sub-category, highlighting quantitatively the differences between the typical layouts of cities in both regions. We also show with the example of New York and its different boroughs, that the fingerprint of a city can be seen as the sum of the ones characterizing the different neighbourhoods inside a city. This method provides a quantitative comparison of urban street patterns, which could be helpful for a better understanding of the causes and mechanisms behind their distinct shapes.},

  abstract = {Activities which in any other context would be described as direct marketing lie at the heart of modern party political campaigning. Indeed, these activities, and the targeting systems that drive them, played a far more important role in the 2005 British general election than they did in any previous one. In 2009, or thereabouts, their role is likely to be even more important in determining who gets to run the country. Yet despite the high visibility of a general election campaign and the implications of the election result on the ordinary lives of direct marketing professionals, relatively little is known in the direct marketing industry about the extent to which political parties use the segmentation practices which underlie the majority of campaigns in the commercial sector. This paper seeks to address this lack of understanding, using interviews with communications managers in the three main political parties supplemented by experience in providing advice to two of the parties on information strategy both before and during the election. In particular it analyses differences between parties and commercial advertisers in terms of the environment within which they work; reviews the data and data management practices that the parties employed during the recent general election; provides information on the parties' own evaluation of their communications campaigns; and assesses how the use of segmentation techniques is likely to evolve in subsequent campaigns, for both Westminster and other parliaments.},

Together they chart the origins of this practice and explain the challenges it poses to long-established social scientific beliefs such as: the role of the questionnaire in an era of big data the primacy of theory the relationship between qualitative and quantitative modes of understanding the relevance of visual clues to lay understanding. To help readers evaluate the validity of this form of classification, the book assesses how well geodemographic categories track the emergence of new types of residential neighbourhood and subject a number of key contemporary issues to geodemographic modes of analysis."\textendash},

After analysing the powerful role of spatial and territorial metaphors in anchoring current discourses about information technologies and society, the article goes on to identify three broad, dominating perspectives. These I label the perspective of ?substitution and transcendence? (dominated by technological Utopianists), the ?co-evolution? perspective (drawing from political economy and cultural studies) and the ?recombination? perspective (derived from recent work in actor-network theory). The discussion turns to each in turn, extracting the geographical dimensions and implications of each. The article concludes by considering the implications of the discussion for spatial treatments of societytechnology relations and for broader debates about the nature of space and place.},

Written in an accessible,non-technical and witty style, this book marks the beginning of theAl revolution in geography with major implications for teaching andresearch. The authors provide an easy to understand basicintroduction to Al relevant to geography. There are no specialmathematical and statistical skills needed, indeed these might wellbe a hindrance. Al is a different way of looking at the world andit requires a willingness to experiment, and readers who areunhindered by the baggage of obsolete technologies and outmodedphilosophies of science will probably do best. The text provides anintroduction to expert systems, neural nets, genetic algorithms,smart systems and artificial life and shows how they are likely totransform geographical enquiry. * A major methodological milestone in geography * The first geographical book on artificial intelligence (Al) * No need for previous mathematical or statisticalskills/knowledge * Accessible style makes a difficult subject available to a wideaudience * Stan Openshaw is one of the world s leading researchers intogeographical computing, spatial analysis and GIS.},

  abstract = {This article describes an emergent logic of accumulation in the networked sphere, ?surveillance capitalism,? and considers its implications for ?information civilization.? The institutionalizing practices and operational assumptions of Google Inc. are the primary lens for this analysis as they are rendered in two recent articles authored by Google Chief Economist Hal Varian. Varian asserts four uses that follow from computer-mediated transactions: data extraction and analysis,? ?new contractual forms due to better monitoring,? ?personalization and customization, ? and continuous experiments. ? An examination of the nature and consequences of these uses sheds light on the implicit logic of surveillance capitalism and the global architecture of computer mediation upon which it depends. This architecture produces a distributed and largely uncontested new expression of power that I christen: Big Other. ? It is constituted by unexpected and often illegible mechanisms of extraction, commodification, and control that effectively exile persons from their own behavior while producing new markets of behavioral prediction and modification. Surveillance capitalism challenges democratic norms and departs in key ways from the centuries-long evolution of market capitalism.},

  abstract = {This paper demonstrates that bitcoin's medium- to long-term price follows Metcalfe's law. Bitcoin is modeled as a token digital currency, a medium of exchange with no intrinsic value that is transacted within a defined electronic network. Per Metcalfe's law, the value of a network is a function of the number of pairs transactions possible, and is proportional to n-squared. A Gompertz curve is used to model the inflationary effects associated with the creation of new bitcoin. The result is a parsimonious model of supply (number of bitcoins) and demand (number of bitcoin wallets), with the conclusion bitcoin's price fits Metcalfe's law exceptionally well. Metcalfe's law is used to investigate Gandal's et.al. [2018] assertion of price manipulation in the Bitcoin ecosystem during 2013-2014.},

When the unit is the Census Bureau's nine geographic divisions, the correlation between illiteracy rate and per cent of Negroes is .95; when the unit is the 48 states, the correlation is .77; and when using individual correlations between color and illiteracy based upon census tabulations the correlation is .20.

  abstract = {In 1980s, Robert Metcalfe, the inventor of Ethernet, proposed a formulation of network value in terms of the network size (the number of nodes of the network), which was later named as Metcalfe's law. The law states that the value V of a network is proportional to the square of the size n of the network, i.e., V {$\propto$} n2. Metcalfe's law has been influential and an embodiment of the network effect concept. It also generated many controversies. Some scholars went so far as to state ``Metcalfe's law is wrong'' and ``dangerous''. Some other laws have been proposed, including Sarnoff's law (V {$\propto$} n), Odlyzko's law (V {$\propto$} nlog(n)), and Reed's law (V {$\propto$} 2n). Despite these arguments, for 30 years, no evidence based on real data was available for or against Metcalfe's law. The situation was changed in late 2013, when Metcalfe himself used Facebook's data over the past 10 years to show a good fit for Metcalfe's law. In this paper, we expand Metcalfe's results by utilizing the actual data of Tencent (China's largest social network company) and Facebook (the world's largest social network company). Our results show that: 1) of the four laws of network effect, Metcalfe's law by far fits the actual data the best; 2) both Tencent and Facebook data fit Metcalfe's law quite well; 3) the costs of Tencent and Facebook are proportional to the squares of their network sizes, not linear; and 4) the growth trends of Tencent and Facebook monthly active users fit the netoid function well.},
